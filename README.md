# Catch The Ball

Welcome to Catch The Ball,

In this simple yet fun game, players control a character or object tasked with catching falling balls. The balls drop from the top of the screen at increasing speeds, and the player must move left or right to catch them before they hit the ground. Each successful catch earns points, while missing a ball reduces the playerâ€™s score or ends the game. The goal is to catch as many balls as possible and achieve the highest score. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases with faster ball drops!
